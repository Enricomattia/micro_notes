This thesis studies principles underlying individual behaviour, information processing, and resource allocation. It focuses on foundational issues in behavioural economics, where the concepts investigated in this thesis are introduced. Behavioural economics—which examines variations in individual behaviour, belief revision, and normative judgement—has historically been characterized by a reduced-form approach \citep{spieglerBehavioralEconomicsAtheoretical2019}. This approach explains empirical observations through reinterpretations of classical theoretical constructs that intuitively capture relevant psychological mechanisms. In contrast, I argue that more nuanced treatments are necessary, requiring the development of novel theoretical tools rather than merely reinterpreting existing ones. As a result, I derive distinctions within the behavioural phenomena under study that are difficult to discern without explicit modelling.
