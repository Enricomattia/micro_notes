These are notes for the first part of the PhD microeconomics sequence. They cover choice under uncertainty and general equilibrium theory. The write-up is not yet fully polished, and I will keep updating it. If you spot mistakes or typos, please let me know. I have aimed for a conversational style rather than the more formal tone of, say, \citet{mas-colellMicroeconomicTheory1995}. I assumed no knowledge of the topics, but, as usual, mathematical sophistication helps (I hope you develope it during the class!). Each lecture outlines what we discuss in class, followed by exercises and suggestions for further reading. Each time a result is proved, I attempted to give the easier proof possible. This means that explanations and proofs are a bit longer than necessary, but more accessible.

Before starting, you may enjoy some non-technical background that frames the topics we’ll study: \citet[ch.~1]{krepsNotesTheoryChoice1988}, \citet[pp.~ix–xi]{debreuTheoryValueAxiomatic1959}, \citet[pp.~1–7]{myersonGameTheoryAnalysis1997}, and \citet[chs.~1–2]{gilboaTheoryDecisionUncertainty2009}.

\begin{techremark}
	You will occasionally see smaller text like this. These remarks are not essential for following the main exposition, but they add context or point to related ideas. Feel free to skip them on a first pass.

These notes draw on several sources. The main reference is \cite{mas-colellMicroeconomicTheory1995}, but both here and in the text you can find references for alternatives or complements. Below is a short reading list. If you would like more pointers on any topic, just ask—I am happy to discuss questions and related material, just drop me an email.
