These notes are a first draft for the opening part of the PhD microeconomics sequence. They cover choice under uncertainty and general equilibrium. The write-up is not yet fully polished, and I will keep updating it. If you spot mistakes or typos, please let me know. I have aimed for a conversational style rather than the more formal tone of, say, \citet{mas-colellMicroeconomicTheory1995}. I assumed no knowledge of the topics, but, as usual, mathematical sophistication helps (I hope you develope it during the class!). Each lecture outlines what we discuss in class, followed by exercises and suggestions for further reading.

Before we start, you may enjoy some non-technical background that frames the topics we’ll study: \citet[ch.~1]{krepsNotesTheoryChoice1988}, \citet[pp.~ix–xi]{debreuTheoryValueAxiomatic1959}, \citet[pp.~1–7]{myersonGameTheoryAnalysis1997}, and \citet[chs.~1–2]{gilboaTheoryDecisionUncertainty2009}.

\begin{techremark}
	You will occasionally see smaller text like this. These remarks are not essential for following the main exposition, but they add context or point to related ideas. Feel free to skip them on a first pass.

These notes draw on several sources. Below is a short reading list. If you would like more pointers on any topic, just ask—I am happy to discuss questions and related material, just drop me an email.
